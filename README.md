# Node Tasks CLI

## Description

I made this application following the course of Fernando Herrera ("Node de cero a experto").

## What did I use?

In this project I use the following packages:

+ Inquirer: to show a beautiful menu
+ Colors: to display colors on the messages in the console

## How run this app?

1. Check if you have Node and NPM installed

    ```bash
    node --version
    npm --version
    ```

2. Install the dependencies

    ```bash
    npm i
    ```

3. Run the app

    ```bash
    node app.js
    ```
